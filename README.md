This is my final year project in which I designed and developed an intelligent security robot with self-navigation.

I tried to make the autonomous surveillance robot as efficient as possible, to replace all or most of the tasks performed by a human supervisor, and to save effort, time, and money. the robot navigates and at the same time searches for strangers in its environment. First, it navigates by detecting all the obstacles in its pattern. Then I implemented an efficient and fast person detection system that works in real-time, with an alarm system to alert the user in the robot's environment. I also designed a program to control and visualize the robot using a device such as a smartphone or a computer connected to an internet network. This makes it possible to observe and control the robot in real-time at any time.

For the hardware, I used Raspberry Pi 4, Arduino Uno, Rpi Camera 2, 3 ultrasonic sensors, 2 servo motors, a buzzer, 4 motors with H-bridge, 2 batteries, an LDR sensor, and LEDs.

For development tools, I used Fritzing for hardware concept, Solidworks for mechanical design, Arduino IDE for development in Arduino, Ms Visual Studio, Putty, and VNC viewer for development in Raspberry with Ubunto Linux as an operating system.

The main programming language was Python3 with RPi.GPIO, Numpy, Imutils, Flask, Open CV, and smtplib as the main Python libraries. I also used C++ for Arduino programming, Java Script, HTML, and CSS for the web application.
